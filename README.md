# Los Santos Fire Department

Los Santos Fire Department is fictional fire station located in GTA 5 game world. In 2020, I played GTA role-play a lot, so when I became Fire Chief I decided to build a company website.

## Prelude
**Attention!** This website is my first ever web project built in 2020. I share it on purpose, so you can see progress I have made in all this years. I intentionally don't correct any mistake I have done, because it is kind of a souvenir :D

## Challenge

- Build a landing page for fire station
- Allow user to reach out to the chief using contact form.

## Outcome

- Use [HTML5][html5] and [CSS3][css3] to create the layout and pages
- Use [Formspree][formspree] library for server-less contact form

### Local version - Installation

No server required, Yeey! Download .zip or clone repository and open `index.html` to see the website.
